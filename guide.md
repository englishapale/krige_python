So the very first step is you open the main_window.py, and then you see this (see Figure 1), you can see this main window is called Krige Application,and there are widgets in this window. So all the widgets can be seen by using the scrollbars in the right hand side of window, bottom of window(see Figure 1).

Now look at the widget called 1.Select File (Figure 2), there are two buttons Open One File and Open Multiple Files, so when Open One File is pressed, then you"ll get the file directory of all the files. So this tool only loads .xlsx, .xls, .csv, files, so when you press confirm to pick your one file, the file will load inside the widget(Figure 2), and this file will only load if there are three columns. If there are more than three columns in the file, then a new window will pop up(Figure 3). This window will ask you which of the columns you choose as your Longitude, Latitude, Results
